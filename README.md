# Support Vector Machine (SVM) Implementation

This repository contains the implementation of the Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm as part of a course project.

## Overview

This project involves the implementation of the SVM algorithm, a powerful method for both classification and regression tasks. The notebook includes steps to preprocess the data, implement the SVM model, and evaluate its performance. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of SVM in handling classification tasks with a focus on accuracy and performance metrics.
